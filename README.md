# World of Wiki
*â€¦which is more like Europe of Wiki, but whatever.*

Exploring Wikipedia articles in various languages. **See it in action [here](https://havranej.shinyapps.io/wiki/)**.

Searches for language variations of a given English Wikipedia article and measures their length (in characters). Collected data are then plotted on the map of Europe, like this:

![Prague example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/havranej/world-of-wiki/master/plot-examples/Prague.png)

Or this:

![Nitrogen example](https://github.com/havranej/world-of-wiki/blob/master/plot-examples/nitrogen.png)

Each state was assigned the language that has the most speakers there. It might not be the most accurate method and I am aware it might even upset some people, but it was the best solution I could think of. If you feel that something should be different, please, let me know!

Montenegrin Wikipedia doesn't exist yet (besides incubator) and was therefore replaced by the Serbo-Croatian version (sh.wikipedia.org).

# World of Wiki
*â€¦which is more like Europe of Wiki, but whatever.*

Exploring Wikipedia articles in various languages.

Searches for language variations of a given English Wikipedia article and measures their length (in characters). Collected data are then plotted on the map of Europe.

Each state was assigned the language that has the most speakers there. It might not be the most accurate method and I am aware it might even upset some people, but it was the best solution I could think of. If you feel that something should be different, please, let me know!

Montenegrin Wikipedia doesn't exist yet (besides incubator) and was therefore replaced by the Serbo-Croatian version (sh.wikipedia.org).
